    Through this book, you will build an app that allows a user to capture notes very quickly.

    Here are the key things we will cove in this application:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Designing the wireframe of our application
        \item Understanding and coding this in HTML
        \item Making the design look good with CSS
        \item Adding interaction to our application with JavaScript
    \end{itemize}

    Along the way, you will also pick all the tools professionals use to make web application every day. This will be things like Vercel, VS Code, and more.

    If you're not familiar with any of these, don't worry we will cover this and many more.
