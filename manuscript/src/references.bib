  abstract = {Platform [ ] iOS  [ x] Android  Obsidian Mobile version: v0.0.xx  1.4.2 (94)   I would like to quickly capture an idea without any overhead. That means, I do not want to think about a title or so, just key in a snippet. This note should go either to root or a dedicated folder. At home on the PC, I could add Title and any structural information.  Do you have any hint/workflow to use Obsidian on my mobile that way?},
