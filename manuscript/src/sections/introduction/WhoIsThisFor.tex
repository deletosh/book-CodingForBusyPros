\section{Who is book for?}\label{sec:how-is-book-for?}
My starting assumption is that you want to learn the fundamentals of coding\textemdash enough to build a few websites yourself.

Here are a few more things I assume about you:
\begin{itemize}
    \item You're an adult and OK with the frustration and joy of learning something new, as an adult.
    \item You're curious and want to finally understand what this ``coding'' thing is all about.
    \item You have a computer you will be able to practice along with this book.
    I'm sorry, a phone alone will not work.
    \item You're probably working one or several jobs, and you can work to fit this in
    (maybe because you want to transition into tech)
    \item You can dedicate at least 15 mins, every day to work with this book till you're done.
\end{itemize}

If you don't fit into any of this, I'm glad I've saved you some time; you won't get value from this book.

If this is you, we're going to have some fun.

First, let's agree on how best to use this book to save yourself some time.
