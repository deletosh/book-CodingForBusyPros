\section{Can't I Just use ChatGPT?}\label{sec:why-not-chatgpt?}

Since the release ChatGPT in November 2022, many ask: "Can't I just type a few words and get code back,
why bother to code from scratch"

That's a good point and keep on mind,
using ChatGPT requires that you know what to ask in the first place and importantly, what the result should look like.

Think of it this way:

If you ask ChatGPT to compose a poem, it requires you know a few things:

\begin{itemize}
    \item You know what a poem is,
    \item You know what a poem should look like (so you can at least know if ChatGPT is lying to you or not),
    \item You Know what you intend to do with the poem when it comes back
\end{itemize}

It's the same with creating with code.

You need to understand the fundamentals, so you can use tools like ChatGPT to it's full power.
That's the point of this book.
It gives you the fundamentals so that you're able to use tools like ChatGPT to its fullest.

Throughout this book, I will share sections that tools like ChatGPT can help you accomplish things.

With this, you get more power for the buck.
