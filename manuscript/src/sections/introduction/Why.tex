\section{Why This Book}\label{sec:why-this-book}

Pre-COVID-19 being tech-literate was nice-to-have.
The world has changed.
Not only must you be tech-literate;
your future success also needs you to know how to instruct computer, which means code.

And as an adult trying to maintain all your usual responsibility, where do you even start?

That's where this book comes in.

Most coding books assume you either want to become a professional software engineer
(no harm with that) or you have lots of time to set aside and focus on just coding.

Then they add a bigger assumption:

You should dedicate all your time to learning and remembering all the coding jargonâ€¦

This book is different.

I start with the assumption that you're an adult with a lot more responsibility than you can currently handle.
You know you need to learn to code; but\ldots

Where's the time?

Where do you even start?

This book is for you.

In this book, we take the shortest path necessary to building web applications with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
No confusing
jargon, no software-engineer mambo-jumbo; just you, building a real-world application step-by-little-step, at your own
pace.

You fit it somewhere between your 9 to 5, or 5 to 9 or a 12 to 1 break, you find small bits of time, this book gets you there.

To start us both on the same page, let me confirm my assumption about you.
