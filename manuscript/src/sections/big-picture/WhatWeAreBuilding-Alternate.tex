    As you're aware, it's hard to focus on the news,
    we will build an app that allows us to find news based on what what matters to us,
    and use AI to give us a summary of the key points.

    Here are the key features of this app:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item It should have a clean and simple experience
        \item it allows us to find news sources based on our interest
        \item It recommends reading materials to us based on our interest
        \item We get a nice and simple summary based on how interest.
    \end{itemize}
