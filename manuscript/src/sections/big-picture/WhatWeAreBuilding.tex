    We're building an app that allows us to quickly capture ideas and notes without any overhead.
    This app was inspired by a feature request on the Obsidian forum~\cite{FeatureWorkflowQuickly2023}
    The design of the app is inspired by\href{https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/}{The Archive}.

    Here are the key features we're going to build:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item It should have a clean and simple experience
        \item A user can add notes quickly
        \item How notes are saved somewhere, so we can come back to it/
        \item We can search for notes we have saved previously
        \item We should be able to easily browse our notes
        \item We can add relevant tags to our notes (think hashtags) so we can find it later
    \end{itemize}

    I know you can't wait, at the end of this book, here's what your app will look like:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Go to\href{https://to.dto.sh/cfbp-app}{Slipbox App}
        \item Play with the app
    \end{enumerate}

    What we will start with is not the coding (I see a smile on your face) â€”
    first we will design what we intern to build.
    This is where most web application design starts; we will do the same.
