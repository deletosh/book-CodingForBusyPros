### Why this Book?

Most coding book assumes one thing: you have a lot of time to learn to code before you can build anything useful.
Sometimes, that's true AND, they add this other assumption:

You should dedicate all your time to learning and remembering all the coding jargon....

That’s what this book does different.

This book assumes you're an adult with a lot of other things pulling at your time but you know you really should learn
to code... but...

Where's the time... 😖

Where do you even start?! 🤔

This book is for you.

This book takes the shortest path necessary to building web applications with HTML, CSS and Javascript. No confusing
jargon, no software-engineer mumbo-jumbo; just you, building a real-world application step-by-little-step, at your own
pace.

You fit it somewhere between your 9 to 5, or 5 to 9 or 12 to 1, you find small bits of time, this book gets you there.

So if you’re ready to learn how to code without all the
fuss. [Download the latest version now](https://github.com/deletosh/book-CodingForBusyPros/releases)
