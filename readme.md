### Why this Book?

Most coding book assumes one thing: you have a lot of time to learn to code before you can build anything useful.
Sometimes, that's true AND, they add this other assumption:

You should dedicate all your time to learning and remembering all the coding jargon‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs what this book does different.

This book assumes you're an adult with a lot of other things pulling at your time, but you know you really should learn
to code... but...

Where's the time... üòñ

Where do you even start?! ü§î

This book is for you.

This book takes the shortest path necessary to building web applications with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. No confusing
jargon, no software-engineer mambo-jumbo; just you, building a real-world application step-by-little-step, at your own
pace.

You fit it somewhere between your 9 to 5, or 5 to 9 or 12 to 1, you find small bits of time, this book gets you there.

So if you‚Äôre ready to learn how to code without all the
fuss.
